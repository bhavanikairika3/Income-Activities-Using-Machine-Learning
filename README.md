# Project Title: Income Activities Analysis

# Project Overview:
The "Income Activities" project focuses on analyzing income patterns across different geographic regions using machine learning regression techniques. The primary goal is to model and predict income activities, providing valuable insights into socioeconomic disparities. This project aims to support policy formulation and contribute to economic development efforts by understanding and forecasting income trends.

# Dataset Columns:
- **ADM0_NAME, ADM1_NAME, ADM2_NAME:** Geographic region details.
- **Income_Category, Income_SubCategory:** Categorization of income activities.
- **Income_Month, Income_Year:** Temporal dimensions of income data.
- **IncomeValue:** The recorded value of income.
- **Indicator_Type, Income_DataSource:** Additional information about income sources.

# Target Variable:
The target variable for this analysis is **Income_Month**. The objective is to predict the month in which income is expected.

# Workflow Summary:
1. **Data Collection:** The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing information on geographic regions, income categories, and temporal dimensions.
  
2. **Machine Learning Model Building:** A machine learning algorithm was developed to analyze the dataset. The code for this model has been saved using Pickle for easy retrieval and integration into the project.

3. **Backend Development:** The backend of the project has been completed, incorporating the machine learning model to predict income months based on the provided dataset.

4. **Frontend Development:**
   - **Home Page:** Includes an overview of the project, its objectives, and its significance in understanding income activities.
   - **Input Page:** Contains forms for user input, capturing all variables except the target variable (Income_Month).
   - **Output Page:** Displays the predicted target variable (Income_Month) based on the provided input.

5. **Static Assets:**
   - CSS files, images, and other static assets are organized in the "static" folder to enhance the frontend design and user experience.

# Next Steps:
- **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of the frontend to ensure a seamless user experience and accurate predictions.
  
- **Deployment:** Explore deployment options for the project, making it accessible to a wider audience.

- **Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation on how to use the front end, interpret results, and understand the significance of the project.

- **Feedback and Improvements:** Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements to enhance the project's functionality and user satisfaction.

By combining machine learning with a user-friendly frontend, the "Income Activities" project aims to contribute to data-driven decision-making processes and foster a better understanding of income dynamics across different regions.
